  Accidentally in Love
by Counting Crows


[Intro]

G   C   G   D
G   C   Em  A   C  (hold)


[Verse]

G                     C
So she said what's the problem baby
G                         C
What's the problem I don't know
                 Em
Well maybe I'm in love (love)
               A
Think about it everytime I think about it
C
Can't stop thinking 'bout it

G                       C
How much longer will it take to cure this?
G                       C                     Em
Just to cure it 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)
               A                             D
Makes me wanna turn around and face me but I don't know
             C
Nothing 'bout love            Ahhhh


[Chorus]

G             Am
Come on, come on
C             D
Turn a little faster
G             Am
Come on, come on
    C                 D
The world will follow after
G             Am
Come on, come on
C                 D     Em  A  C
'Cause everybody's after love


[Verse 2]

G              C
So I said I'm a snowball running
G                     C                           Em
Running down into the spring that's coming all this love
              A                      C
Melting under blue skies belting out sunlight
           G
shimmering love
          C                  G
Well baby I surrender to the strawberry ice cream
C                         Em
never ever end of all this love
       A
Well I didn't mean to do it
           D                C
But there's no escaping your love   ahhhhh


[Bridge]

Em            C
These line of lightning mean we're
G            Am
never alone, never alone
N.C.
no no


[Chorus]

G             Am
Come on, come on
C             D
Move a little closer
G             Am
Come on, come on
    C              D
I want to hear you whisper
G             Am
Come on, come on
C           D         Em  D
Settle down inside my love            Ahhhh

G             Am
Come on, come on
C             D
Jump a little higher
G             Am
Come on, come on
       C             D
If you feel a little lighter
G             Am
Come on, come on
   C                D       Em  A   C    (stop)
We were once upon a time in love


[Bridge]

                   G       C
We're accidentally in love
                   Em      D
We're accidentally in love
                   G       C
We're accidentally in love
                   Em      D
We're accidentally in love
                   G       C
We're accidentally in love
                   Em      D
We're accidentally in love
                   G       C
We're accidentally in love
                   Em      D
We're accidentally in love

G                   C
I'm in love, I'm in love
                    Em
I'm in love, I'm in love
                    D
I'm in love, I'm in love


[Chorus]

G             Am
Come on, come on
C             D
Spin a little tighter
G             Am
Come on, come on
        C                D
And the world's a little brighter
G             Am
Come on, come on
     C              D        Em    D             G
Just get yourself inside her love.....I'm in love
